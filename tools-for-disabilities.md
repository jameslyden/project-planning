Tools for Disabilities
======================

Computers, and physical computing constructs in particular, have a lot of potential for augmenting humans in so many ways that there must be millions of great ideas in this area that haven't been thought of yet. That said, I'm not terribly interested in making the next cool toy. I want to make a real difference. What better way to do so than to harness the power of physical computing to ease the burdens of individuals with disabilities?

Now I just need to know what needs are out there -- what can computers do, whether simple tasks or wildly, absurdly complex ones, that would help compensate for disabilities?
