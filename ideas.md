Future Project Ideas
====================

### Paper cutter
Cricut replacement for cutting paper, etching PCBs, etc.

* perhaps use a laser instead of a blade as the cutting implement?
* Swappable cutting/etching/piercing heads for different uses?

### Music writer
Get notes on input and write them to file.

* Notes would be from a digital source
  * the electronic drum kit?
  * an audio frequency ADC attached to a guitar or piano?
* The output file should be in a standard format, preferably one that:
  * is fairly human-readable
  * is easily rendered as sheet music


### Dremel CNC
A CNC machine with a commodity high-speed rotary tool as its cutting head

* start with 3 axis
  * The paper cutter would be a good proving ground for a lot of the control code
  * Final goal is a 5-axis design, with three linear axes and two rotational axes for the head
* Should be compatible with at least one common file format
  * G-code is the defacto standard and an obvious choice
  * What formats can be produced by open-source 3D CAD tools?
